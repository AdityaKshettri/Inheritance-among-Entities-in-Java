# Inheritance-among-Entities-in-Java
In this project, I have worked on Inheritance concept among Entities to save two or more similar types of entities within same table in the database using h2-console.

# How to see the demo

1- Run the application by running the InheritanceInEntityApplication.class file

2- Goto localhost:8080/h2-console in the browser.

3- Click on Connect as the default settings will be prsent there.

4- In the editor, write the script "select * from products" and click on Run.

5- You will see the book and pen entities saved differently in the same table.
